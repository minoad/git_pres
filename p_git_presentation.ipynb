That is done with the <code>git checkout</code> command.  You can execute the cell below to see this in operation.  Branching allows for you to segragate tasks.  If you are editing or fixing a problem in one section, creating a branch will make sure the edits or resolutions to other sections are not pushed back at the same time.\n",
